**This repo is specially created for ci/cd pipelines using Azure-Devops**

*Prerequisites for Azure DevOps Pipelines :-*
1. Azure DevOps Organization
You need an Azure DevOps organization. If you donâ€™t have one, you can create it at [Azure DevOps Services](https://dev.azure.com/).
2. Project Setup
Create a project within your Azure DevOps organization where the pipelines will be defined and managed.
3. Source Code Repository:
Your source code should be stored in a repository that Azure DevOps can access. 
    This can be:
    - Azure Repos (Git or TFVC)
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/PrachiVpatil96/AzureDevops-Pipelines)
    - Bitbucket
    - Other Git repositories
